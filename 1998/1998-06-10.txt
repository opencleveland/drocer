An emergency resolution withholding local community approval
as required by the Ohio Department
of Youth Services in connection with
the construction of the juvenile
detention center and affiliated court
buildings at East 22nd Street.
Whereas, the Council of the City
of Cleveland is in receipt of Resolutions adopted by the Board of

22
County Commissioners for Cuyahoga
County as well as the Juvenile
Court Judges, adopted by those
respective bodies on or about May
28, 1998, approving a three phase
plan for the construction of a juvenile detention center and affiliated
court buildings and other accessories, as set forth in the design
drawing of Thomas Zung, Architects/Richard Bowen & Associates,
dated May 28, 1998; and
Whereas,
local
community
approval is also required by the Ohio
Department of Youth Services as
indicated in the outline of required
steps in the correspondence of April
30, 1998, addressed to the Board of
County
Commissioners
from
the
Director of the Ohio Department of
Youth Services, Geno Natalucci-Persichetti; and
Whereas, the local community
authority is constituted in the City
Council who is not opposed to the
plan indicated above, but is not willing to provide local community
approval unless and until the following conditions have been satisfied:
(a) A detailed timetable for all
phases being constructed has been
provided; and
(b) A realistic and identifiable
source of funding for all three
phases has been put in place binding the County and all sources of
such funding so as to accomplish
same within the next three to five
years; and
(c) That the Council is satisfied
as to the long range viability of the
plan and that it is conducive to the
proper care of the children being
housed and handled in such facilities.
Whereas, the proposed site on and
about the existing premises for the
Juvenile Court on 22nd Street is contrary to the City Zoning Code, in
that Section 337.08(e)(8) specifically
prohibits correctional facilities in
this zoning district, and that any
use in contradiction of the Code
which is non-conforming in nature
must obtain a zoning variance for
any “enlargement or expansion” pursuant to Chapter 359 of the Codified
Ordinances of the City of Cleveland,
1976; and
Whereas, the County Commissioners have not addressed the concerns
as protected under Chapter 161 of
the Codified Ordinances relating to
Landmark Commission approvals,
and buildings of a special historic,
community, or aesthetic interest or
value; and
Whereas, as the protector of the
local community, it is this Council’s
duty, before approving the proposed
plan, to assure that the proper care
is being provided to the children of
this community, and that the plan
will provide a viable institution for
the protection of the health, safety,
and welfare of our constituents;
and
Whereas, although Council is not
opposed to the plan at this time,
approval is being withheld until
such time as the aforementioned
conditions and concerns have been
satisfied, and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department;
Now, therefore, be it resolved by
the Council of the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland, does hereby and
herein formally serve notice upon
the Ohio Department of Youth Services, the Cuyahoga County Board

The City Record
of Commissioners, and the County
Juvenile Court Judges, that they are
withholding
local
community
approval as required in the Ohio
Department of Youth Services letter
of April 30, 1998, until such time as
all of the conditions indicated above
have been satisfied, and do further
serve notice upon the aforementioned that the subject site is not in
compliance with all Code and Zoning requirements as is also required
in the Ohio Department of Youth
Services correspondence of April 30,
1998.
Section 2. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland is ready, willing
and able to work with the County

this Council strongly oppose; and

notices to its employees, and return
to the bargaining table to reach a

electric
service
standards
