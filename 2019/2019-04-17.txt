Res. No. 482-2019.
By Council Member Zone.
An emergency resolution urging
the
Ohio
General
Assembly
to
increase the Ohio Rape Crisis Centers Line Item in the Ohio Operating
Budget
from
$1,550,000
to
$3,000,000 per fiscal year.
Whereas, sexual assault affects
persons of all social, racial, religious, ethnic, socioeconomic, and
age groups in the Cleveland community; and
Whereas, taking many forms, sexual violence can include incest, child
abuse, commercial sex trafficking,
sexual harassment, stalking, and
acquaintance, stranger, spousal, and
gang rape, and nearly seventy percent of these crimes are committed
by individuals known to the victim;
and
Whereas, according to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention,
approximately one in five women
and one in seventy-one men will
experience rape or an attempted
rape at some point in their lives,
with children and young adults
being at a significant risk of this
crime; and
Whereas, along with the immediate physical and emotional costs of
sexual assault, the victims can have
such adverse consequences as posttraumatic stress disorder, substance
use, major depression, homelessness,
eating disorders, and suicide, providing that sexual assault survivors
suffer from emotional scars long
after the physical scars have healed;
these impacts are visible in the
Cleveland community; and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
and affirms the efforts of Cleveland
Rape Crisis Center and Ohio’s additional 30 Rape Crisis Programs, complying with the Ohio Core Rape
Crisis
Center
Standards,
that
respond to survivors of sexual violence and work to prevent its occurrence in Cleveland and across the
state; and
Whereas, in Cuyahoga, and three
other counties, Cleveland Rape Crisis Center provided life-saving services to more than 10,000 survivors
of sexual violence and their loved
ones in 2018; and
Whereas, Cleveland Rape Crisis
Center and Ohio’s Rape Crisis Programs are eligible for support from
the Ohio Rape Crisis Centers Line
Item that has supported the expansion of services in Ohio from 42
counties in 2014 to 75 counties in
2019; and
Whereas, an increase in the line
item from $1,550,000 to $3,000,000 per
fiscal year is crucial to supporting
efforts to increase services at Cleveland
Rape
Crisis
Center
and
throughout the state of Ohio; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the
Ohio
General
Assembly
to
increase the Ohio Rape Crisis Centers Line Item in the Operating Budget from $1,550,000 to $3,000,000 per
fiscal year.

44109, Permit No. 6617633; and

to the building, safety or health

constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Division of

permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and

in Revised Code Section 4303.292;

An emergency ordinance authorizing the Director of Economic Development to enter into an Enterprise

19
Whereas, by letter dated March 6,
2019, the City provided the Cleveland Metropolitan School District
(“CMSD”) with a notice of proposed
tax exemptions required by the
Revised Code; and
Whereas, under Ordinance No. 94895, passed June 19, 1995, this Council designated an area, which is in
the City of Cleveland and described
in File No. 948-95-A, as the Cleveland
Area Enterprise Zone (the “Zone”)
under Chapter 5709 of the Revised
Code; and
Whereas, under Ordinance No.
1568-14, passed December 8, 2014,
this Council changed the maximum
term of tax abatements from ten to
fifteen years, as now allowed under
Ohio law; and
Whereas, in August, 1995, the
Director of Development of the State
of Ohio determined that the Zone
contains
the
characteristics
described in division (A) of Section
5709.61 of the Revised Code and certified the area as an “Urban Jobs
and Enterprise Zone” under Chapter
5709 of the Revised Code; and
Whereas, Bear Diversified Properties, LLC, or its designee (the
“Enterprise”) has proposed to construct certain real property improvements to assist with the renovations
located at the facility located at
5900-6000 Harvard Avenue as part of
the Northern Stamping expansion
project in the Cleveland Area Enterprise Zone; and
Whereas, the Enterprise has certified to the City that it would be
at a competitive disadvantage operating at this location if taxes on certain real property improvements
were not abated; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, safety, property, and welfare and that its enactment is a necessary prerequisite to
providing immediate assistance to
create and preserve job opportunities and advance and promote commercial and economic development
in the City of Cleveland, and the
assistance is immediately necessary
or jobs will be lost; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
approves the application of the
Enterprise for enterprise zone incentives on the basis that the Enterprise
