An emergency resolution objecting to a New C2 Liquor Permit at
8003 Broadway Avenue.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Division of Liquor Control of an application for a New C2
Liquor Permit at Family Dollar
Stores of Ohio, Inc, DBA Family Dollar, #10417, 8003 Broadway Avenue,
Cleveland, Ohio 44105, Permit No.
26312750340; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Division of
Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Superintendent of Liquor Control within 30
days of notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby record its objection to a New C2

Res. No. 690-2019.
By Council Member J. Jones.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio General Assembly not to
pass House Bill 178, which would
put Ohio citizens at risk by allowing people to carry concealed handguns in public without a required
license or the necessary safety training.
Whereas, gun violence is considered to be one of the major threats
to public health and safety in communities across the country; according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, in 2017
there were 39,773 deaths during that
year, which was up by more than
1,000 the year before; and
Whereas, there are an estimated
279 million firearms in the United
States, which amounts to approximately 90 guns for every 100 people
in the United States, and in 2014, for
every gun death considered justified
for self-defense, there were 34 criminal homicides; and
Whereas, most homicides in the
United States are committed with
firearms, especially handguns; gang
related homicide is most prevalent
among gangs and during the commission of felony crimes, in 1993,
nearly all gang-related homicides
(95%) involved guns, which reached
a major high point, and is still a
problem in urban cities across the
country as gang violence remains a
significant public safety threat; and
Whereas, according to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention,
the rate for firearm deaths in the
State of Ohio was 13.7 in 2017, which
exceeded the U.S. rate of 12.0; and
Whereas, under the current Ohio
law, carrying a concealed handgun
in public without a legal permit is
against the law, and is widely supported by 90 percent of Ohio voters,
according to a 2016 survey; and
Whereas, proposed House Bill 178,
introduced on March 29, 2019, would
allow people to carry concealed
handguns
in
public
without
a
license or firearm safety training,
thus enabling individuals with no
prior firearm training to carry a
concealed
handgun
in
public,
putting potentially many people at
risk for unintentional or intentional
harm; and

May 29, 2019
Whereas, House Bill 178 would
allow individuals with prior violent
misdemeanor offenses to carry a
concealed handgun, thus allowing
them to enter into a public place
carrying a concealed loaded handgun; and
Whereas, House Bill 178 would
allow persons convicted of crimes
involving the possession, use, or
sale of illegal narcotics to carry concealed handguns throughout residential communities; and
Whereas, after the state of Missouri enacted a permitless carry gun
law in January 2017, the city of St.
Louis experienced nearly a 25 percent increase in the rate of aggravated assaults with a gun in 2017
compared to 2016, which represents
a 484 increase in gun related aggravated assaults; and
Whereas, after the state of Arizona enacted permitless carry legislation in 2010, by 2017 the rate of
aggravated assaults with a firearm
increased by 39 percent, which rep1,797
more
gun-related
resents
aggravated assaults committed in
2017 compared to 2010; and
Whereas, after the state of Alaska became the first state to enact
permitless gun carry legislation in
2003, aggravated assaults committed
by a firearm increased significantly
82
percent
by
2017,
which
by
accounts for 526 more gun-related
aggravated assaults committed in
2017 compared to 2003; and
Whereas, there are sixteen states
currently employing some type of
permitless gun carry system, but
most states recognize the importance of regulating concealed gun
carry; and
Whereas, the passage of House
Bill 178 will put the health and safety of Ohio residents at greater risk
by allowing persons with dangerous
histories to carry loaded handguns
into public places; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety;
now therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio General Assembly not to
pass House Bill 178, which would
put Ohio citizens at risk by allowing people to carry concealed handguns in public without a required
license or the necessary safety training.
Section
2.
That
this
Council
directs the Clerk of Council to transmit copies of this Resolution to the
Ohio General Assembly, members of
the Northeast Ohio Legislative Delegation and City of Cleveland Mayor
Frank G. Jackson.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
