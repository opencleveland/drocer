Res. No. 120-2019.
By Council Member Conwell.
An emergency resolution supporting Play it Forward Cleveland!, an
instrument donation drive for Cleveland’s children.
Whereas, it’s difficult to imagine
a world without music, but for
countless children in Cleveland, this
is the reality; and
Whereas, mountains of research
document the positive developmental, academic, social and lifelong
benefits for children engaged in
music; but that requires access to
instruments; and
Whereas, Cleveland City Councilman Kevin Conwell, The Cleveland
Orchestra, Arts Cleveland, Center
for Arts-Inspired Learning and the
Cleveland Metropolitan School District are partnering together with
our community to get instruments
into the hands and lives of Cleveland’s children; and
Whereas, the goal of Play it Forward Cleveland! is to give children
the pride, the joy, and the lifetime
benefits music-making provides; and
Whereas,
the
first
instrument
donation drive is a pilot for Ward 9
children in Glenville, with the intention of expanding the drive in the
future; and
Whereas, multiple cities across
the country have successfully filled
the instrument needs in their underserved communities with similar drives; we want Cleveland to be next;
and
Whereas, community members can
donate
gently-used
instruments,
including
those
requiring
minor
repairs, at Severance Hall, home of
The
Cleveland
Orchestra,
11001
Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, in University Circle, using the East Blvd.
curbside pull-off area, on the following days: Monday, January 21,
2019, Martin Luther King Jr. Day,
from 12-5 pm, Sunday, February 17,
2019, from 12-5 pm, and Saturday,
March 9, 2019, from 10 am to 12
noon; and
Whereas, this Council supports
this donation drive and looks forward to continued partnership to
expand the drive throughout Cleveland’s neighborhoods in the future
for the benefit of Cleveland’ children; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports Play it Forward Cleveland!, an
instrument donation drive for Cleveland’s children.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
