FIRST READING EMERGENCY
ORDINANCES REFERRED

(by departmental request).
An emergency ordinance authorizing the Directors of Economic Development and Community Development to enter into one or more
agreements with the Board of Education of the Cleveland Metropolitan
School District and Vesta Corporation,
or
its
designee,
for
the

January 9, 2019
exchange of the Longfellow School
property with City-owned property
on Addison Avenue for future redevelopment and the mutual benefit of
the parties; and authorizing the
Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies to acquire and convey the properties.
Whereas, the Cleveland Metropolitan School District (“CMSD”) owns
certain property located at 650 East
140th Street, formerly the Henry W.
Longfellow
School
(“Longfellow
Property”); and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
Land Reutilization Program owns
certain vacant property located at
1465
Addison
Avenue
(“Addison
Property”); and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
wishes to enter into one or more
agreements with the CMSD and
Vesta Corporation, or its designee
(“Vesta”), in order to exchange the
properties for the public purposes of
public
education
and
affordable
senior housing; and
Whereas, Section 3313.40 of the
Revised Code permits a board of
education and a municipal corporation to exchange real estate upon a
vote of a majority of members of the
board of education and a concurring
vote of the legislative authority
declaring that said exchange will be
mutually beneficial to both parties;
and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That notwithstanding
and as an exception to Chapters 181
and 183 of the Codified Ordinances
of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976, the Directors of Economic Development and
Community Development and the
Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies are authorized to enter into
one or more agreements (“Agreements”) with the Board of Education of the CMSD, and Vesta, relating
to
the
development
and
exchange of the Longfellow Property for the Addison Property.
Section 2. That Directors of Economic Development and Community
Development are authorized to enter
into any other agreements necessary
to implement this ordinance, including but not limited to, an agreement
with Vesta naming them as the City
of Cleveland’s designee in order to
accept title to the Longfellow Property, subject to Vesta’s redevelopment of the Longfellow Property for
affordable
senior
housing,
and
restrictive covenants.
Section 3. That notwithstanding
