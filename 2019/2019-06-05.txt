Ord. No. 747-2019.
By Council Members Griffin, Kelley, McCormack and Mayor Jackson.
An emergency ordinance to repeal
various sections of Chapters 365 and
240 of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland Ohio, 1976 as amended by
various ordinances and to supplement the Codified Ordinances by
enacting
new
Sections
365.01
through 365.09, 240.01, 240.08, and
240.09, and by amending Sections
240.03, 240.05, 240.06, 240.07, 367.12,
367.99, 371.01, 375.08, and 3107.06, as
amended
by
various
ordinances,
related to rental registration, certain residential rental units required
to be certified lead-safe, lead hazards and lead poisoning prevention.
Whereas, this Council finds that
lead poisoning is a serious threat to
the health of children and, although
lead-based paint was banned in the
United States in 1978, lead-based
paint is still the number one source
of lead exposure in the country; and
Whereas, the majority of residential structures in the City were originally constructed prior to January
1, 1978 and are, therefore, more likely to have lead-based paint hazards;
and
Whereas, children living in residential rental units built before 1978
are disproportionately at risk for
unsafe levels of lead exposure from
lead-based paint hazards; and
Whereas, exposure to lead is most
dangerous to children under 6 years
of age due to their still developing
neurological systems; and
Whereas, in Cleveland, dangerous
levels of lead in a child’s blood is
mostly due to exposure to lead
through deteriorating paint conditions and from soil; and
Whereas, this Council finds that,
although there is no safe level of
lead in the human body, current federal guidelines consider 5 or more
micrograms per deciliter of lead in
a child’s blood to be dangerous and
raises concerns of lead poisoning;
and
Whereas, in 2018, more than 1,230
Cleveland children under 6 years of
age that were tested were shown to
have 5 or more micrograms per
deciliter of lead in their blood; and
Whereas, further, this Council
finds that lead can accumulate in
the brain, kidneys, blood and bones
and can cause learning disabilities,
language delays, hearing problems
and behavioral problems; and
Whereas, one goal of Cleveland’s
Healthy Homes Initiative is to
reduce and prevent lead poisoning;
and

22
Whereas, this Council believes
that requiring all residential rental
units constructed before January 1,
1978 to have lead-safe certification
will help to decrease the incidences
of lead poisoning in the City’s children; and
Whereas, on May 1, 2019, the Policy Committee of the Lead Safe
Cleveland Coalition submitted 33
policy
recommendations
to
this
Council for consideration, which policy recommendations have been duly
considered and are placed in File
No. 747-2019-A; and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
that these policy recommendations
aim to enhance and improve lead
safe efforts of the City and the
Coalition through implementation of
a lead safe certification program,
and further suggest improvements
to lead screening and testing, treatment, intervention, education and
outreach; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health,
or safety in that definitive actions
must continue to address this serious public health threat to children
in this City; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Clevelaand:
Section 1. That the following sections of the Codified Ordinances of
Cleveland, Ohio, 1976:
Sections
365.01,
365.02,
365.03,

9, 2006
and
Section 240.09, as amended by
Ordinance
No.
1027-04,
passed
August 11, 2004
are repealed.
Section 2. That the Codified Ordinances are supplemented by enacting new Sections 365.01, 365.02,
365.03, 365.04, 365.05, 365.06, 365.07,

The City Record
Section 365.04 Lead-Safe Certification Required for Residential Rental
Units Built Before January 1, 1978
(a) Presumption and Policy. Any
residential rental unit originally
constructed prior to January 1, 1978
is presumed to have lead-based
paint. It is the policy of the City to
help prevent the poisoning of children by requiring that the presence
of deteriorated lead-based paint on
the interior and exterior of residential rental structures built before
January 1, 1978 be identified and be
correctly addressed by reducing and
controlling lead-based paint hazards
which may be present, in order to
prevent human exposure to these

or threatening to bring an action for
possession of the tenant’s premises,
terminating or threatening to terminate the tenant’s rental agreement,
or refusing to renew the tenant’s
rental agreement or to continue the

safety;
(2) The tenant has complained to

Res. No. 748-2019.
By Council Members Griffin, Kelley, McCormack and Mayor Jackson.
An emergency resolution calling
upon health organizations including
hospitals and providers of Medicaid
services to guarantee that Cleveland-area infants and children under
age six are screened and tested for
lead to help prevent lead poisoning.
Whereas, Ohio law requires all
healthcare providers to administer
blood lead tests to children at age 1
and 2, or up to age 6 if no previous
test has been completed based on
whether the child is on Medicaid,
lives in a high-risk ZIP code, or has
certain other risk factors; and
Whereas, not enough Ohio children meeting these criteria are tested as required by law: in 2016-17, of
the children receiving Medicaid in
the Cleveland Metropolitan School
District and 11 inner-ring suburban
school districts 90% were tested at
least once between birth and kindergarten entry; 50% were tested at
age one year; 34.6% were tested at
age 2; and 21.5% were tested at both
ages 1 and 2; and
Whereas, this Council understands
that it is most important to first test
lead blood levels in children early between ages one and 2 – and often,
through age 6; and

June 5, 2019
Whereas, area hospital systems,
medical facilities and health care
providers must be the driving force
in providing adequate screening and
testing services that are easily
accessible and readily available to
Cleveland-area children and their
families; and
Whereas, area health organizations
including
hospitals
and
providers of Medicaid services must
make concerted efforts to join with
the Department of Public Health
and the Healthy Homes Advisory
Council to provide screening and
testing of young children where
they are most likely to be – including at schools, area libraries, recreation centers, and through area
community programs; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
that a communication strategy be
developed between the City and outside entities, including Cleveland
public and private schools, to provide lead poisoning prevention education and further encourages the
Department of Health continue to
coordinate with the City’s recreation
centers and other programs operated or funded by the City to provide
lead poisoning prevention information, lead screening and referrals
for lead testing; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
the Department of Public Health to
establish and make public a list of
organizations that provide on-site
and/or mobile screening, testing or
testing referrals; and
Whereas, this Council joins the
Lead Safe Cleveland Coalition in
urging the State of Ohio to establish
a
better
detailed,
timely
and
enforceable database of lead testing
that includes city, county and state
records; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council calls
upon health organizations including
hospitals and providers of Medicaid
services to guarantee that Cleveland-area infants and children under
age six are screened and tested for
lead to help prevent lead poisoning.
Section 2. That the Clerk is directed to forward copies of this resolution to representatives from the
Cuyahoga County Board of Health
and Department of Development,
Case Western Reserve University,
Environmental Health Watch, United Way of Greater Cleveland, the
Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland Metropolitan School District, the MetroHealth System, Sisters of Charity
Health System, University Hospitals,
UH Rainbow Babies & Children’s
Hospital.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS READ IN FULL
AND ADOPTED
Res. No. 731-2019.
By Council Members Kelley, Griffin and J. Jones (by departmental
request).
An emergency resolution strongly
urging the Ohio Governor and Members of the Ohio General Assembly
to restore the Local Government
Fund to pre-recession levels.
Whereas, the Local Government
Fund was reduced in 2011 by 50%
during the Kasich Administration,
from 3.68% of General Revenue
Funds to its current level of 1.66%
of General Revenue Funds; and
Whereas,
past
Ohio
General
Assemblies
have
repeatedly
decreased funding and revenue sharing in recent years in addition to

The City Record
significantly reducing the Local
Government Fund, including eliminating the Estate Tax and phasing
out the Tangible Personal Property
Tax; and
Whereas, these reductions have
resulted in a loss of revenue of
$163,207,902; and
Whereas, this sudden revenue loss
has made it increasingly difficult to
provide basic services, rebuild infrastructure, and bolster public safety
services to fight the opioid epidemic; and
Whereas,
when
municipalities
experience success in fostering safe
communities, building sound infrastructure, and increasing economic
development, the State of Ohio reaps
the benefits as well; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, property, health
or safety in that a reinvestment of
Local Government Fund would aid
the state in its goal of lowering
taxes on the individual by enabling
municipalities to decrease the local
tax burden; now, therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
The
Ohio
General
Assembly should restore the Local
Government Fund to pre-recession
levels, ensuring that these local
communities are able to provide crucial services and improvements in
infrastructure and public safety.
Section 2. This Council does hereby declare its opposition any further
cuts to the Local Government Fund
or the future diversion of revenues
from the Local Government Fund.
Section 3. That this resolution is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
