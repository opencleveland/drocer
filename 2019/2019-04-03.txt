Project Summary and Discussion
CLE Dexter LLC and/or designee
(“Developer”) is proposing a mixed
use development located at 1578
West 28th Street, Cleveland, OH
44113 (corner of West 28th Street
and Franklin Boulevard) (“Project
Site”). In order to assist with the

project will create and/or cause to
create 26 new full-time jobs at the
Project Site with an approximate
payroll of $700,000.
CLE Dexter LLC is an entity of
Casto. Casto is a privately held,
fully integrated real estate services
firm, with more than 85 years of
successful development and management of commercial, industrial
and residential real estate. Casto is
a team of more than 270 individuals

area. Their newest project is the
development of a mixed use building located in Ohio City.
Casto

the
property
located at 1578 West 28th Street, in
February 2019. The total project
investment is expected to exceed

portion of the PILOTs will be
paid to the Cleveland Metropolitan School District in the amount
the District would have otherwise
received but for the TIF by the
County
(“District
Payments”).
The balance of the PILOTS will
be utilized to fund eligible project
costs and project debt. The developer will be responsible for any
shortfall of PILOT payments for

Ord. No. 411-2019.
By Council Member Griffin.
An emergency ordinance establishing a moratorium on the review
and issuance of zoning permits, certificates of occupancy and other
license or permit applications for
small box discount stores.
Whereas,
“small
box
discount
stores” means a retail store of
between 3,000 and 15,000 square feet
that sells at retail, directly to the
consumer, a limited assortment of
physical goods, products, or merchandise, personal grooming and
health products, household goods,
and other consumer products, including food or beverages for offpremise consumption, that generally
cost less than $10 dollars or cost
20% - 40% lower than the same
types of goods, products and merchandise sold at grocery or drug
stores; and
Whereas, there is a proliferation
of small box discount stores such as
Dollar Tree, Family Dollar (owned
by Dollar Tree) and Dollar General
in urban areas including the City of
Cleveland, where Family Dollar currently operates 34 stores; and

The City Record
Whereas, despite Family Dollar’s
recent announcement that it will
close stores in 2019, Dollar General
and other small box discount stores
still plan to expand in small towns
and urban areas where they cater to
low and middle income customers
looking for discounted goods and
where there are often no neighborhood grocery stores; in fact, Dollar
General has announced that it will
open 975 new stores in the United
States this year; and
Whereas, Dollar Tree and Dollar
General have more stores than the
following biggest U.S. retailers Walmart, Kroger, Target, Costco,
Home Depot, CVS and Walgreens –
combined; and
Whereas, although small box discount stores may fill a need in
places that lack basic retail services, the growing evidence is that
small box discount stores are not
only a byproduct of economic distress – they are a cause of it; and
Whereas,
small
box
discount
stores’ strategy of saturating communities with multiple stores makes
it impossible for local grocery stores
to stay open, if they are already in
a neighborhood, or for new local
grocers to open a store and prosper;
and
Whereas, there is usually less
than 15% of shelf space devoted to
fresh produce in small box discount
stores and most have only a limited
selection of processed foods; and
Whereas,
small
box
discount
stores sell packaged foods in singleserving quantities that have lower
price points, but are in actuality
more expensive per ounce; and
Whereas,
small
box
discount
stores employ fewer people at lower
wages than grocery stores, often
face class-action lawsuits for violating fair labor standards and lean
heavily on taxpayers to subsidize
their employees’ healthcare; and
Whereas, profits from small box
discount stores go back to their corporate office, while local business
profits go back to the community in
which they serve; and
Whereas, there are concerns about
safety
and
security
surrounding
small box discount stores because of
the often high incidences of crime
and theft in and around them, often
due to their lack of security; and
Whereas,
“small
box
discount
stores” as defined above does not
include stores that dedicate less
than 5% of shelf space to food sales,
sell gasoline or diesel fuel, contain
a prescription pharmacy, or dedicate
at least 15% of shelf space to fresh
foods and produce; and
Whereas, this ordinance constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of the public peace, property, health, safety, or
welfare in that a moratorium on the
review and issuance of zoning permits, certificates of occupancy and
other license or permit applications
for small box discount stores is necessary while the City considers reasonable restrictions and regulations
for such stores in the City; now,
therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That, for the reasons
stated in the preamble, this Council
establishes a moratorium on the
review and issuance of zoning permits, certificates of occupancy and
other license or permit applications

445

for small box discount stores until
December 31, 2020 or until such time
as the City has established regulations regarding review and issuance
of
small
box
discount
stores,
whichever is earlier.
Section 2. That this ordinance is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and

Effective March 26, 2019.

Res. No. 340-2019.
By
Council
Members
Kelley,
Polensek, Brancatelli and Griffin.
An emergency resolution supporting the proposal that the jurisdiction of the Cleveland Housing Court
be expanded to include felony environmental crimes and administrative appeals from the Cleveland
Board of Zoning Appeals and Cleveland Board of Building Standards.
Whereas, currently, the Cuyahoga
County Environmental Crimes Task
Force (ECTF), comprised of representatives from the City, Cuyahoga
County, the Cuyahoga County Solid
Waste District and local health
departments, refers environmental
crimes to the County Prosecutor;
and
Whereas, the ECTF investigations
unit, led by the Cleveland Police
Department, refers over 40 investigations to a Grand Jury every year;
about half of those cases come
under Ohio’s scrap metal law, RC
Chapter 4737, which violations can
only be prosecuted as felonies; and
Whereas, currently, two Assistant
County Prosecutors are dedicated to
environmental
felonies;
however,
any judge seated on the County
Court of Common Pleas may be
assigned an environmental felony
case; and
Whereas, it is proposed that Cleveland’s Housing Court be assigned
all Cuyahoga County environmental
cases; and
Whereas,
Cleveland’s
Housing
Court is already familiar with the
City’s building codes and environmental laws, therefor assigning all
felony environmental cases to one
judge in the Housing Court would
make the system more efficient
while
maintaining
the
Housing
Court’s goals of code compliance
and deterring future code violations;
and
Whereas, similar to Cleveland’s
Housing Court, the Franklin County
Municipal
Court’s
Environmental
Court has felony jurisdiction over
environmental cases; and
Whereas, currently, appeals from
decisions by the Board of Building
Standards (BBS) and the Board of
Zoning Appeals (BZA) are assigned
to one of 34 Common Pleas Court
judges; and

The City Record
Whereas, it is proposed that Housing Court and Common Pleas would
have concurrent jurisdiction to hear
BBS and BZA appeals, with the
appealing party deciding where to
file the appeal; and
Whereas,
Housing
Court
has
expertise in the types of decisions
appealed
from
BBS
and
BZA
because many involve use of property and housing code violations;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the proposal that the jurisdiction of
the Cleveland Housing
Court be expanded to include felony
environmental crimes and administrative appeals from the Cleveland
Board of Zoning Appeals and Cleveland Board of Building Standards.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to forward a
copy of this resolution Ronald J.H.
O’Leary, Judge, Cleveland Housing
Court.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted March 25, 2019.
Effective March 26, 2019.

Res. No. 343-2019.
By Council Members Zone, Brancatelli, J. Jones, Polensek, and
Mayor Jackson.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio General Assembly to implement a statewide Climate Action
Plan to mitigate current effects and
reduce future impacts of climate
change based on scientific evidence.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
and the State of Ohio have been
leaders in protective environmental
action, including actions to restore
the Cuyahoga River from past damages; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
released an updated 2018 Cleveland
Climate Action Plan, which includes
28 objectives all designed to reduce
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by
80% by 2050 and make Clevelanders
more resilient to the impacts of climate change; and
Whereas, the State of Ohio can
take its place among the many other
states that have implemented climate action plans to reduce environmental impact and attempt to
maintain a planet that is recognizable to what it is now; and
Whereas, the State of Ohio should
do its part to reduce GHG emissions
to a level below 350 parts per million to protect its most vulnerable
residents from the impacts of climate change; and
Whereas, climate change is a present threat and is caused, and therefore can be resolved, by human
action; and

455

17
Whereas, the impacts of climate
change are imminent and have
grave social and economic consequences; and
Whereas, the impacts of climate
change will burden all future generations and climate change will
continue to worsen if action is not
taken immediately; and
Whereas, the costs of allowing climate change to continue to worsen
are much greater than the costs of
changing current practices; and
Whereas, the current amount of
atmospheric greenhouse gases, estimated to be approximately 410 parts
per million, are leading to devastating impacts, including but not limited
to:
increased
temperatures,
heightened sea levels, more frequent
severe weather events, increased
rates of species extinction, and significantly increased asthma rates in
children and young adults; and
Whereas, a full assault on climate
change will benefit countless generations, both current and upcoming;
and
Whereas, this Council and Mayor
Jackson’s Office of Sustainability,
along with the students in the Environmental Heroes Program at the
Leonard Gelfand STEM Center, Case
Western Reserve University, including
Vincent
Aldewereld,
Aidan
Holdsworth, Anthony Koonce, Lily
Kwiatkowski, Kathryn Kwiatkowski, Cecelia Ross, Hannah Ross,
Maya Serna, and Nina Serna, urge
the
Ohio
General
Assembly
to
include youth in the development of
a climate action plan; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council and
the Jackson Administration urge the
Ohio General Assembly to implement a statewide Climate Action
Plan to mitigate current effects and
reduce future impacts of climate
change based on scientific evidence.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit a copy of
this resolution to the Ohio General
Assembly and Kathryn Kwiatkowski, Director-Math and Science Programs,
Leonard
Gelfand
STEM
Center, Case Western Reserve University.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

the Cuyahoga Land Bank Brownfield

18
Whereas,
the
Cuyahoga

Whereas, Slavic Village Development Organization is submitting a

Whereas, 5936 Ackley Road is an

of Cleveland; and
Whereas, Slavic Village Development Organization intends to assist
in the redevelopment of the property, zoned local retail and formerly
with auto-related uses, to a secured
parking facility for Cleveland Central Catholic High School; and
Whereas, the City is committed to
working with Slavic Village Development Organization to pursue the
remediation and redevelopment of
the property; and
Whereas,
the
Cuyahoga
Land
Bank’s grant is vital to making the
completion of the 5936 Ackley Road
redevelopment project economically
feasible; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the application from Slavic

to the Cuyahoga Land Bank Brownfield
