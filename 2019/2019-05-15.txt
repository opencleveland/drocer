ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 569-2019.
By Council Members Cleveland,
Zone and McCormack.
An emergency resolution opposing
Senate Bill 23 which prohibits abortion when a fetal heartbeat is
detected.
Whereas, on April 11, 2019, Governor DeWine signed Senate Bill 23
into law, which prohibits an abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected; and
Whereas, this prohibition negatively impacts a woman’s right to
reproductive health care services in
Cleveland and the State of Ohio by
effectively eliminating access to all
legal
abortion
services
without
exceptions for cases of rape and
incest and without adequate protections for the life and health of the
woman; and
Whereas, this law is one of the
most restrictive bans on abortions in
the United States; similar laws
passed in other states have been
universally ruled unconstitutional;
and
Whereas, under Senate Bill 23 doctors and others who perform abortions would face felony charges if
they perform an abortion after
detecting a heartbeat or if they fail
to perform an abdominal or transvaginal ultrasound to check for a
heartbeat; and
Whereas, threatening doctors with
prison time and fines for performing
this
medical procedure will negatively impact the ability of this city
to attract and retain qualified medical professionals; and

44
Whereas, rather than implementing regressive and extreme policies
like Senate Bill 23, Ohio legislators
should instead focus on implementing and providing supportive services not only to reduce unintended
pregnancies but also to assist pregnant women, and to promote the success of families by investing in
comprehensive sex education, access
to contraceptives, parenting classes
and quality affordable childcare;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes Senate Bill 23 that prohibits abortion when a fetal heartbeat is
detected.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted May 6, 2019.
Effective May 7, 2019.

Res. No. 601-2019.
By Council Member Polensek.
An emergency resolution objecting to a New C1 Liquor Permit at
1201 East 185th Street.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Division of Liquor Control of an application for a New C1
Liquor Permit at 1201 Oil, Inc., DBA
Hanini Express, 1201 East 185th
Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44119, Permit
No. 6552450; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Division of
Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section

The City Record
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Superintendent of Liquor Control within 30
days of notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby record its objection to a New C1
Liquor Permit at 1201 Oil, Inc., DBA
Hanini Express, 1201 East 185th
Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44119, Permit
No. 6552450; and requests the Superintendent of Liquor Control to set a
hearing for said application in
accordance with provisions of Section 4303.26 of the Revised Code of
Ohio.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she is hereby directed to
transmit two certified copies of this
resolution, together with two copies
of a letter of objection and two
copies of a letter requesting that the
hearing be held in Cleveland, Cuyahoga County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted May 6, 2019.
Effective May 7, 2019.
