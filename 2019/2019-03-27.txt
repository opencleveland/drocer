Whereas, the granting of this

Whereas, the place for which the

to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Division of
Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based

and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation

Res. No. 342-2019.
By
Council
Members
Kelley,
Polensek and Griffin.
An emergency resolution supporting Ohio Senate Bill 37 that extends
eligibility for and revises the Motion
Picture Tax Credit; and urging the
Senate to expand the maximum
amount of credits that may be
awarded annually to $100 million.
Whereas, Senate Bill 37, which
extends eligibility for and revises
the Motion Picture Tax Credit, was
introduced in the Ohio Senate on
February 12, 2019 and sponsored by
Senator Kirk Schuring; and
Whereas,
a
strong
Ohio
film
industry will help retain Ohio’s vast
population of young talent by creating jobs, provide retraining opportunities and jobs for displaced workers, and bring new businesses and
job
opportunities
for
Ohioans,
according to the Greater Cleveland
Film Commission’s President, Ivan
Schwarz; and
Whereas, since passage of the
Ohio Motion Picture Tax Credit in
2009, which reimburses motion picture production companies 30 percent of what they spend in Ohio for
goods, services and payroll, media
production has brought in over $572
million in economic impact to the
state and paid for the equivalent of
4,162 full-time jobs, according to a
Cleveland State University study;
and
Whereas, this study confirms that
Ohio has benefited economically
from a return on investment of $2.01
for every $1 invested by the tax
incentive; and
Whereas, despite these economic
benefits, Ohio has lost over a billion
dollars in production that would
have filmed here if the incentive
were higher, and if we had infrastructure in place; and
Whereas, our neighboring states,
including Illinois and Pennsylvania,
currently have higher caps in their
tax incentive programs; and
Whereas, Senate Bill 37 extends
eligibility for the tax credit to certain Broadway theatrical productions; adds post-production advertising, and promotional expenses to
the expenditures for which the credit may be claimed; disqualifies any
production that does not begin within 90 days after being certified as
eligible; stipulates that tax credit
certificates are to be awarded in
two rounds each fiscal year; and
requires each round’s applications to
be ranked and granted on the basis
of the economic and workforce
development impact of the production; and
Whereas, Senate Bill 37 should
also increase the annual cap on the
total amount of tax credits allowed
from $40 million to $100 million dollars; and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
the economic benefits from the
Motion Picture Tax Credit, and supports Senate Bill 37 in order to
expand these benefits in Cleveland
and throughout Ohio; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

The City Record
Section 1. That this Council supports Ohio Senate Bill 37 that
extends eligibility for and revises
the Motion Picture Tax Credit; and
urging the Senate to expand the
maximum amount of credits that
may be awarded annually to $100
million.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
