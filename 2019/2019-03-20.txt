to provide for tax abatement for certain real property improvements to

Harvard Avenue as part of the
Northern Stamping expansion project in the Cleveland Area Enterprise Zone.
Whereas, by letter dated March 6,
2019, the City provided the Cleveland Metropolitan School District
(“CMSD”) with a notice of proposed
tax exemptions required by the
Revised Code; and
Whereas, under Ordinance No. 94895, passed June 19, 1995, this Council designated an area, which is in

Code; and

of the public peace, safety, property, and welfare and that its enactment is a necessary prerequisite to
providing immediate assistance to
create and preserve job opportunities and advance and promote commercial and economic development
in the City of Cleveland, and the
assistance is immediately necessary
or jobs will be lost; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That

Council
approves the application of the
Enterprise for enterprise zone incentives on the basis that the Enterprise

and
to
improve the economic climate of the
City of Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Director of
Economic Development is authorized to enter into an Enterprise
Zone Agreement with the Enterprise
to provide for a ten-year, sixty percent (60%) tax abatement for certain real property improvements
commencing the first year for which

would first be taxable were that
property not exempted from taxation; the abatement shall be subject
to annual review of the Tax Incentive Review Council.
Section 3. That the terms of the
tax abatement shall be in accordance with the terms in the Summary contained in File No. 322-2019A. These terms shall not be amended, nor shall the tax abatement be

entity, without the prior legislative
authorization
by
Cleveland
City
Council.

Economic Development is authorized to charge and accept fees in
an amount not to exceed the maximum allowable under Chapter 5709
of the Revised Code and the funds
are appropriated for the purposes
listed in Chapter 5709 of the Revised
Code. The fees shall be deposited to
and expended from Fund No. 17 SF
305.
Section 5. That the contract and
other appropriate documents needed
to complete the transaction authorized by this legislation shall be prepared by the Director of Law.

or jobs will be lost; now, therefore,
Be it ordained by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section
1.
That
this
Council
approves the application of the
Enterprise for enterprise zone incentives on the basis that the Enterprise
is
qualified
by

City of Cleveland.
Section 2. That the Director of

held by the City of Cleveland and
the real property is then leased or

the Revised Code, the exemption
may exceed 75% of the improvements for up to 30 years when a portion of the service payments so collected are distributed to the Cleveland City School District (“District”)
in an amount equal to the amount
the District would have received
had
the
improvement
not
been
exempt; and
Whereas, the District has been
notified of the intent to enter into
the agreement authorized by this
ordinance in compliance with Sections 5709.41(C)(4) and 5709.83 of

SUMMARY FOR THE
LEGISLATIVE FILE
Project
Name:
Tappan
Building
Development
Project
Address:
2703
Scranton
Road, Cleveland, OH 44113
Developer: Sustainable Community
Associates, LTD. or Designee
Project Manager: Dan Kennedy
Ward/Councilperson: 3-Kerry McCormack
City Assistance: Non-School TIF
Project Summary and Discussion
Sustainable
Community
Associates, LTD or designee, (“Developer”)
is proposing a mixed use development located at 2703 Scranton Road,
Cleveland, OH 44113 (“Project Site”).
In order to assist with the project
financing,
the
Developer
has
requested the City impose a 5709.41,
30-Year, Non-School TIF. The TIF
will support debt service related to
the project and assist with the
development
of
95
market
rate
apartments,
approximately
2,148
square feet of retail space, and
parking for residents. The project
will create and/or cause to create 8
new full-time jobs at the Project
Site with an approximate payroll of
$400,000.
The new $22M building will be
located across the street from the
recently restored, Wagner Awning
Building. The first floor will feature
a bakery, gym, lounge, and amenity
spaces. At 4 stories and 95 unites,
the building is designed to balance
Wagner Awning and anchor a southern gateway into Tremont. The
units will primarily be studios and
smaller 1-bedrooms, complementing
the larger 1-bedroom units at Wagner Awning, which are fully leased.
Because the lending is partially
structured as an opportunity zone
investment, they are able to include
a work-force housing component to
the project. This has the net effect
of keeping 60% of the units at rents
$250-300 below competing developments in Ohio City.

8
The site is a 1.7 acre former gas
station. Once complete, the project
will fill in a major vacancy in the
center of the historic Scranton Road
Corridor that links Metro Hospital’s
expanding campus to the new developments on the Scranton Peninsula
in the Flats.
Proposed City Assistance
• The request to Cleveland City
Council is to authorize the
Director of Economic Development to enter into a 30-year

Finance (TIF) agreement with

improvements with respect to
the project to be a public purpose and exempt 100% of the
improvements from real property taxes.
• Under the agreement, parcels
acquired and re-conveyed to the
developer will be subject to a
TIF under Section 5709.41 of the
Ohio Revised Code in consideration for the developer agreeing to make certain improvements to those parcels and making payments in lieu of taxes
(PILOTs) equal to the taxes
that would have been paid for
those parcels but for the TIF.
A portion of the PILOT will be
paid to the Cleveland Municipal
School District in the amount
the District would have otherwise received but for the TIF.

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTIONS REFERRED
Res. No. 340-2019.
By Council Members Kelley and
Polensek.
An emergency resolution supporting the proposal that the jurisdiction of the Cleveland Housing Court
be expanded to include felony environmental crimes and administrative appeals from the Cleveland
Board of Zoning Appeals and Cleveland Board of Building Standards.
Whereas, currently, the Cuyahoga
County Environmental Crimes Task
Force (ECTF), comprised of representatives from the City, Cuyahoga
County, the Cuyahoga County Solid
Waste District and local health
departments, refers environmental
crimes to the County Prosecutor;
and
Whereas, the ECTF investigations
unit, led by the Cleveland Police
Department, refers over 40 investigations to a Grand Jury every year;
about half of those cases come
under Ohio’s scrap metal law, RC
Chapter 4737, which violations can
only be prosecuted as felonies; and
Whereas, currently, two Assistant
County Prosecutors are dedicated to
environmental
felonies;
however,
any judge seated on the County
Court of Common Pleas may be
assigned an environmental felony
case; and
Whereas, it is proposed that Cleveland’s Housing Court be assigned
all Cuyahoga County environmental
cases; and
Whereas,
Cleveland’s
Housing
Court is already familiar with the
City’s building codes and environmental laws, therefor assigning all
felony environmental cases to one
judge in the Housing Court would
make the system more efficient
while
maintaining
the
Housing
Court’s goals of code compliance
and deterring future code violations;
and
Whereas, similar to Cleveland’s
Housing Court, the Franklin County
Municipal
Court’s
Environmental
Court has felony jurisdiction over
environmental cases; and
Whereas, currently, appeals from
decisions by the Board of Building
Standards (BBS) and the Board of
Zoning Appeals (BZA) are assigned
to one of 34 Common Pleas Court
judges; and
Whereas, it is proposed that Housing Court and Common Pleas would
have concurrent jurisdiction to hear
BBS and BZA appeals, with the
appealing party deciding where to
file the appeal; and
Whereas,
Housing
Court
has
expertise in the types of decisions
appealed
from
BBS
and
BZA
because many involve use of property and housing code violations;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports the proposal that the jurisdiction of
the Cleveland Housing
Court be expanded to include felony
environmental crimes and administrative appeals from the Cleveland
Board of Zoning Appeals and Cleveland Board of Building Standards.

The City Record
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is hereby directed to forward a
copy of this resolution Ronald J.H.
O’Leary, Judge, Cleveland Housing
Court.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period

Res. No. 341-2019.
By Council Members Kelley and
Polensek.
An emergency resolution supporting Governor DeWine’s proposed 18
cent gas tax increase to fund road
construction projects.
Whereas, Governor DeWine has
proposed an 18-cent per gallon gas
tax increase in the state transportation budget to pay for road
construction projects; and
Whereas, the state has not raised
the gas tax in 14 years: the tax has
been 28 cents a gallon since 2005;
and
Whereas, the current 28 cents per
gallon tax is insufficient for state
and local governments to maintain
current roads or finish major new
construction projects – by 2023, the
state will have zero money for road
improvements or road safety projects; and
Whereas, last week, Ohio House
republicans approved a 10.7 cents
per gallon gas tax increase, which
the Governor has decried as a “minimalist approach” to addressing the
state’s infrastructure needs that will
jeopardize the safety of Ohioans;
and
Whereas, imminently, the state
will begin paying $390 million per
year to service highway bonds that
have paid for road and highway projects over the previous several
years; and
Whereas, a gas tax increase of 18
cents a gallon would raise $2.5 billion in additional revenue over the
next two years, compared to about
$1.1 billion in the House proposal;
and
Whereas, the Governor’s 18 cent
gas tax increase would allow local
governments more choice about how
to spend local funds; and
Whereas, the governor’s proposed
18 cent gas tax increase will ensure
that major infrastructure projects
are not delayed and further will
ensure that the our roads and infrastructure remain in satisfactory condition for the safety of Ohioans; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports Governor DeWine’s proposed
18 cent gas tax increase to fund
road construction projects.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to forward a copy of
this
resolution
Governor
Mike
DeWine and all members of the
Ohio legislature.

By Council Members Zone, Brancatelli, J. Jones, Polensek, and
Mayor Jackson.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio General Assembly to implement a statewide Climate Action
Plan to mitigate current effects and
reduce future impacts of climate
change based on scientific evidence.
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
and the State of Ohio have been
leaders in protective environmental
action, including actions to restore
the Cuyahoga River from past damages; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
released an updated 2018 Cleveland
Climate Action Plan, which includes
28 objectives all designed to reduce
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by
80% by 2050 and make Clevelanders
more resilient to the impacts of climate change; and
Whereas, the State of Ohio can
take its place among the many other
states that have implemented climate action plans to reduce environmental impact and attempt to
maintain a planet that is recognizable to what it is now; and
Whereas, the State of Ohio should
do its part to reduce GHG emissions
to a level below 350 parts per million to protect its most vulnerable
residents from the impacts of climate change; and
Whereas, climate change is a present threat and is caused, and therefore can be resolved, by human
action; and
Whereas, the impacts of climate
change are imminent and have
grave social and economic consequences; and
Whereas, the impacts of climate
change will burden all future generations and climate change will
continue to worsen if action is not
taken immediately; and
Whereas, the costs of allowing climate change to continue to worsen
are much greater than the costs of
changing current practices; and
Whereas, the current amount of
atmospheric greenhouse gases, estimated to be approximately 410 parts
per million, are leading to devastating impacts, including but not limited
to:
increased
temperatures,
heightened sea levels, more frequent
severe weather events, increased
rates of species extinction, and significantly increased asthma rates in
children and young adults; and
Whereas, a full assault on climate
change will benefit countless generations, both current and upcoming;
and
Whereas, this Council and Mayor
Jackson’s Office of Sustainability,
along with the students in the Environmental Heroes Program at the
Leonard Gelfand STEM Center, Case
Western Reserve University, including
Vincent
Aldewereld,
Aidan
Holdsworth, Anthony Koonce, Lily

Kwiatkowski, Kathryn Kwiatkowski, Cecelia Ross, Hannah Ross,
Maya Serna, and Nina Serna, urge
the
Ohio
General
Assembly
to
include youth in the development of
a climate action plan; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council and
the Jackson Administration urge the
Ohio General Assembly to implement a statewide Climate Action
Plan to mitigate current effects and
reduce future impacts of climate
change based on scientific evidence.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit a copy of
this resolution to the Ohio General
Assembly and Kathryn Kwiatkowski, Director-Math and Science Programs, Leonard Gelfand STEM Center, Case Western Reserve University.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and

By
Council
Members
Kelley,
Polensek and Griffin.
An emergency resolution supporting Ohio Senate Bill 37 that extends
eligibility for and revises the Motion
Picture Tax Credit; and urging the
Senate to expand the maximum
amount of credits that may be
awarded annually to $100 million.
Whereas, Senate Bill 37, which
extends eligibility for and revises
the Motion Picture Tax Credit, was
introduced in the Ohio Senate on
February 12, 2019 and sponsored by
Senator Kirk Schuring; and
Whereas,
a
strong
Ohio
film
industry will help retain Ohio’s vast
population of young talent by creating jobs, provide retraining opportunities and jobs for displaced workers, and bring new businesses and
job
opportunities
for
Ohioans,
according to the Greater Cleveland
Film Commission’s President, Ivan
Schwarz; and
Whereas, since passage of the
Ohio Motion Picture Tax Credit in
2009, which reimburses motion picture production companies 30 percent of what they spend in Ohio for
goods, services and payroll, media
production has brought in over $572
million in economic impact to the
state and paid for the equivalent of
4,162 full-time jobs, according to a
Cleveland State University study;
and
Whereas, this study confirms that
Ohio has benefited economically
from a return on investment of $2.01
for every $1 invested by the tax
incentive; and
Whereas, despite these economic
benefits, Ohio has lost over a billion
dollars in production that would
have filmed here if the incentive
were higher, and if we had infrastructure in place; and
Whereas, our neighboring states,
including Illinois and Pennsylvania,
currently have higher caps in their
tax incentive programs; and
Whereas, Senate Bill 37 extends
eligibility for the tax credit to certain Broadway theatrical productions; adds post-production advertising, and promotional expenses to
the expenditures for which the credit may be claimed; disqualifies any
production that does not begin within 90 days after being certified as
eligible; stipulates that tax credit
certificates are to be awarded in
two rounds each fiscal year; and
requires each round’s applications to
be ranked and granted on the basis
of the economic and workforce
development impact of the production; and
Whereas, Senate Bill 37 should
also increase the annual cap on the
total amount of tax credits allowed
from $40 million to $100 million dollars; and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
the economic benefits from the
Motion Picture Tax Credit, and supports Senate Bill 37 in order to
expand these benefits in Cleveland
and throughout Ohio; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,

Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports Ohio Senate Bill 37 that
extends eligibility for and revises
the Motion Picture Tax Credit; and
urging the Senate to expand the
maximum amount of credits that
may be awarded annually to $100
million.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
