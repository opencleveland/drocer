FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION REFERRED
Res. No. 265-2019.
By Council Members McCormack
and Hairston.
An emergency resolution supporting the appeal for an increase in
state investments in public transportation.
Whereas, currently, Ohio ranks
near the bottom among states for
public transportation funding; and
Whereas, for too long, Ohio has
underinvested in public transportation and alternative transportation
options; and
Whereas,
satisfactory
public
transportation is an issue of equity:
inadequate
public
transportation
options make it harder for many
Ohioans to go about their daily lives
- get to work, attend class, or see a
doctor; and
Whereas, State Representatives
Skindell and Upchurch have called
for an increase in state investment
in public transit; and
Whereas,
reinvesting
in
the
state’s infrastructure will attract
business and development, connect
people to jobs and services and help
grow Ohio’s economy; and
Whereas, public transposition is
critical to short and long term economic development; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports the appeal for an
increase in state investments in public transportation.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to all members of the
Ohio legislature.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
