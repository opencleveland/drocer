Res. No. 682-2019.
By Council Members Kelley, Zone,
and Brancatelli.
An emergency resolution recognizing Cuyahoga50, a communitywide celebration of 50 years of
progress since the last Cuyahoga
River fire, and the need for continued vigilance and partnership with
regional, state, and federal entities
to ensure every Clevelander has
access to clean water.
Whereas, The City of Cleveland
honors those individuals in Cleveland and beyond that, over the last
50 years, are responsible for the
recovery and re-naturalization of the
Cuyahoga River, while also creating
a model for how recreation and
industry can co-exist; and
Whereas, from Wednesday, June
19th through Sunday, June 23rd, the
City of Cleveland celebrates 50
years of progress on the Cuyahoga
River with 25 events over 5 days,
making
Cuyahoga50
the
largest
series of clean water events in the
country; and
Whereas, the Cuyahoga River is
an important resource in northeast
Ohio,
providing
jobs;
drinking
water; and fishing, boating, and
swimming opportunities; and
Whereas, clean water has been a
key component of Mayor Jackson’s
Sustainable Cleveland 2019 initiative, a 10-year plan to advance
progress in making Cleveland a
“green city on a blue lake”; and
Whereas, the Cuyahoga River has
come a long way from its past,
marking 50 years of progress since
the river last caught on fire in on
June 22, 1969; and
Whereas, the 1969 fire was just
seen as another fire on the Cuyahoga River until Cleveland Mayor
Carl Stokes sparked public outcry
and demand action in Cleveland and
across the nation, spurring Congress
to establish the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency in 1970 and pass
the federal Clean Water Act in 1972;
and
Whereas, the Clean Water Act
established critical water quality
protection rules that helped clean
our lakes, rivers, streams, and wetlands; and

16
Whereas, as we celebrate how
much water quality has improved
over the last 50 years, the Clean
Water Act protections for streams
and wetlands are being eliminated
by the federal administration, ignoring the critical benefits provided by
these water bodies; and
Whereas, by eliminating protections for these small and seasonal
streams and wetlands, Lake Erie
will likely experience more nutrient
pollution leading to potentially larger and more toxic algal blooms; and
Whereas, agricultural pollution is
largely unregulated and yet is the
largest source of nutrient pollution
to Lake Erie, a source of drinking
water for approximately 3 million
Ohioans; and
Whereas, this Council established
the Lake Erie Water Quality Subcommittee to study the effects of
algae blooms on our water supply;
Cleveland Water and Water Pollution Control have served as leading
water utilities, working to make significant
water
infrastructure
upgrades that address algae blooms
and other threats to clean water;
and
Whereas, there is still an approximately $27 billion need in Ohio over
the next 20 years in water infrastructure upgrades; and
Whereas, clean water is not only
our greatest natural resource, it also
drives our economy – 1.5 million
jobs in the Great Lakes region rely
on our freshwater resource; and
Whereas,
the
Great
Lakes
Restoration Initiative is critical to
the health of the Cuyahoga River
and Lake Erie, with more than $13
million already invested to fund
over 40 projects to remediate and
restore the Cuyahoga River; and
Whereas, in 1969, the Cuyahoga
River served to divide the east and
west sides of the city more than
unite them; now, a healthy Cuyahoga can help bridge the two, helping to extinguish racial barriers and
serve
as
a
community
meeting
place; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland is
committed
to
addressing
clean
water issues related to affordability, access, education, and resiliency;
and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
will continue to implement the
Cleveland
Climate
Action
Plan,
including its focus on making Clevelanders more resilient to the impacts
of climate change, including more
rain and more intense storms; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland is
working toward returning to its
roots as the “Forest City”, in collaboration with the Cleveland Tree
Coalition, with the goal of a 30%
tree canopy by 2040, and the ultimate goal of achieving 40%; and
Whereas, the City of Cleveland
requests all members of the Ohio
General Assembly to call for the
reinstatement of the Clean Water
Rule to protect small, seasonal
streams
and
wetlands;
support
increased funding for the Great
Lakes Restoration Initiative and
water
infrastructure;
prioritize
green infrastructure and farm bill
funding for projects that improve
water quality; establish Ohio as a
national leader in the development
of the blue economy; and ensure our
most
vulnerable
residents
have
access to clean, affordable water;
and

The City Record
Whereas, in 1969, the primary
water problem was industrial pollution, while today, the major threats
to clean water are different than
those faced in 1969: climate change,
drought, plastic pollution, invasive
species,
agricultural
runoff
and
harmful algae blooms, among others; and
Whereas, like in 1969, the City of
Cleveland is committed to partnering with regional, state, and federal entities to address meet these
challenges; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety;
now therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. This Council recognizes
Cuyahoga50, a community-wide celebration of 50 years of progress since
the last Cuyahoga River fire, and
the need for continued vigilance and
partnership with regional, state, and
federal entities to ensure every
Clevelander has access to clean
water.
Section 2. This Council directs the
Clerk of Council to send copies of
this resolution to the Ohio Environmental
Council,
Max
Schaefer,
Regional Director and the Alliance
for the Great Lakes.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

An emergency resolution objecting to a New C2 Liquor Permit at
8003 Broadway Avenue.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Division of Liquor Control of an application for a New C2
Liquor Permit at Family Dollar
Stores of Ohio, Inc, DBA Family Dollar, #10417, 8003 Broadway Avenue,
Cleveland, Ohio 44105, Permit No.
26312750340; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Division of
Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth

18
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Superintendent of Liquor Control within 30
days of notification; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That Council does hereby record its objection to a New C2

Res. No. 690-2019.
By Council Member J. Jones.
An emergency resolution urging
the Ohio General Assembly not to
pass House Bill 178, which would
put Ohio citizens at risk by allowing people to carry concealed handguns in public without a required
license or the necessary safety training.
Whereas, gun violence is considered to be one of the major threats
to public health and safety in communities across the country; according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, in 2017
there were 39,773 deaths during that
year, which was up by more than
1,000 the year before; and
Whereas, there are an estimated
279 million firearms in the United
States, which amounts to approximately 90 guns for every 100 people
in the United States, and in 2014, for
every gun death considered justified
for self-defense, there were 34 criminal homicides; and
Whereas, most homicides in the
United States are committed with
firearms, especially handguns; gang
related homicide is most prevalent
among gangs and during the commission of felony crimes, in 1993,
nearly all gang-related homicides
(95%) involved guns, which reached
a major high point, and is still a
problem in urban cities across the
country as gang violence remains a
significant public safety threat; and

The City Record
Whereas, according to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention,
the rate for firearm deaths in the
State of Ohio was 13.7 in 2017, which
exceeded the U.S. rate of 12.0; and
Whereas, under the current Ohio
law, carrying a concealed handgun
in public without a legal permit is
against the law, and is widely supported by 90 percent of Ohio voters,
according to a 2016 survey; and
Whereas, proposed House Bill 178,
introduced on March 29, 2019, would
allow people to carry concealed
handguns
in
public
without
a
license or firearm safety training,
thus enabling individuals with no
prior firearm training to carry a
concealed
handgun
in
public,
putting potentially many people at
risk for unintentional or intentional
harm; and
Whereas, House Bill 178 would
allow individuals with prior violent
misdemeanor offenses to carry a
concealed handgun, thus allowing
them to enter into a public place
carrying a concealed loaded handgun; and
Whereas, House Bill 178 would
allow persons convicted of crimes
involving the possession, use, or
sale of illegal narcotics to carry concealed handguns throughout residential communities; and
Whereas, after the state of Missouri enacted a permitless carry gun
law in January 2017, the city of St.
Louis experienced nearly a 25 percent increase in the rate of aggravated assaults with a gun in 2017
compared to 2016, which represents
a 484 increase in gun related aggravated assaults; and
Whereas, after the state of Arizona enacted permitless carry legislation in 2010, by 2017 the rate of
aggravated assaults with a firearm
increased by 39 percent, which represents
1,797
more
gun-related
aggravated assaults committed in
2017 compared to 2010; and
Whereas, after the state of Alaska became the first state to enact
permitless gun carry legislation in
2003, aggravated assaults committed
by a firearm increased significantly
by
82
percent
by
2017,
which
accounts for 526 more gun-related
aggravated assaults committed in
2017 compared to 2003; and
Whereas, there are sixteen states
currently employing some type of
permitless gun carry system, but
most states recognize the importance of regulating concealed gun
carry; and
Whereas, the passage of House
Bill 178 will put the health and safety of Ohio residents at greater risk
by allowing persons with dangerous
histories to carry loaded handguns
into public places; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety;
now therefore
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Ohio General Assembly not to
pass House Bill 178, which would
put Ohio citizens at risk by allowing people to carry concealed handguns in public without a required
license or the necessary safety training.

Res. No. 644-2019.
By Council Member Zone.
An emergency resolution objecting to the transfer of ownership of
a C1 and C2 Liquor Permit to 1337
West 117th Street.
Whereas, Council has been notified by the Division of Liquor Control
of
an
application
for
the
transfer of ownership of a C1 and
C2 Liquor Permit from Cleveland

856

May 22, 2019
Finance Company, LLC, 1337 West
117th Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44107,
Permit Number 1544382 to West
117th Beverage, LLC, 1337 West
117th Street, Cleveland, Ohio 44107,
Permit No. 9555774; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Division of
Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.
Council’s objection to said permit
must be received by the Superintendent of Liquor Control within 30
