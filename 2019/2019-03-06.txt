approximate amount as purchased
during the preceding term, to be
purchased by the Commissioner of
Purchases and Supplies on a unit
basis for the Division of Streets,
Department of Public Works. Bids
shall be taken in a manner that permits an award to be made for all
items as a single contract, or by separate contract for each or any combination of the items as the Board
of Control determines. Alternate
bids for a period less than the specified term may be taken if desired
by the Commissioner of Purchases
and Supplies until provision is made
for the requirements for the entire
term.
Section 2. That the costs of the
contract
or
contracts
shall
be
charged against the proper appropriation accounts and the Director
of Finance shall certify the amount
of any purchase under the contract,
each of which purchases shall be
made on order of the Commissioner

contract or contracts and certified
by the Director of Finance. (RQN

declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION REFERRED
Res. No. 300-2019.
By Council Member B. Jones.
An emergency resolution designating
Newton
Avenue
between
East 97th Street and East 101st
Street as a residential permit parking area for residents.
Whereas, the Director of Public
Safety has received verified petitions by residents living in eighty
percent (80%) of the living units in
the area of Newton Avenue between
East 97th Street and East 101st
Street; and
Whereas, the Director of Public
Safety has completed a survey of
the above mentioned street and the
surrounding areas, has held a public hearing, and has determined that
this one-way residential street is
surrounded by many commercial
developments, therefore widespread
use of available curbside parking
spaces
by
non-resident
vehicles
results in a lack of nearby curbside
parking for residents; and
Whereas, the Director of Public
Safety has therefore determined that
Newton Avenue between East 97th
Street and East 101st Street is eligible for residential permit parking
and has recommended to Council
that it designate said street as a residential permit parking area; and
Whereas, Council Member Basheer
Jones concurs in the Director’s recommendation; and
Whereas, Newton Avenue between
East 97th Street and East 101st
Street has otherwise met the objective criteria set forth in Chapter 461
of the Codified Ordinances of Cleveland, Ohio, 1976; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby
designates
Newton
Avenue
between East 97th Street and East
101st Street a residential permit
parking area, twenty-four (24) hours
per day, seven (7) days per week.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it received
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
