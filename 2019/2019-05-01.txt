Project Description:
The Gateway lots, located at the corner of E. 4th and Prospect, have long been an underutilized area for downtown Cleveland. As surface lots, these parcels created a gap in the urban fabric and broke up the vitality of the
connection between the strong and growing assets at E. 4th Street & Euclid Avenue and the huge draws of Progressive Field & Quicken Loans Arena.
Gateway Huron, LLC, an affiliate of Stark Enterprises, has acquired these lots to launch Project NuCLEus, a
truly transformative development that will change the face of the Gateway District and leverage this key location. Their proposed mixed-use development will be an attraction for shoppers, workers, and residents in itself
and a strong compliment to the existing assets in downtown. In addition to the large surface lots at E. 4th and
Prospect, the development site also encompasses neighboring outdated parking garages to the east and a small
building on Prospect Avenue adjacent to the site. The project includes a large amount of Class A office space
which is critically needed in downtown Cleveland.
The initial development proposes to construct 277 residential rental units, approximately 400,000 sf of gross commercial office, 77,820 square feet of national credit tenant retail, approximately and 1,350 parking spaces, and
pedestrian oriented infrastructure improvements. The project proposes to construct two towers on top of retail
and parking, topping out at 24 stories, on the surface parking lot on the corner of E. 4th Street and Prospect
that will straddle the East 6th walkway, creating two structures at ground level, that are connected above via
the garage. Additionally, the development proposes substantial improvements to the E. 6th Street walkway, creating a “Laneway” modeled on successful retail developments in Melbourne, Australia. It is anticipated that as
many as 1,000 individuals could be employed at the project site.

FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION REFERRED
Res. No. 569-2019.
By Council Members Cleveland,
Zone and McCormack.
An emergency resolution opposing
Senate Bill 23 which prohibits abortion when a fetal heartbeat is
detected.
Whereas, on April 11, 2019, Governor DeWine signed Senate Bill 23
into law, which prohibits an abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected; and
Whereas, this prohibition negatively impacts a woman’s right to
reproductive health care services in
Cleveland and the State of Ohio by
effectively eliminating access to all
legal
abortion
services
without
exceptions for cases of rape and
incest and without adequate protections for the life and health of the
woman; and
Whereas, this law is one of the
most restrictive bans on abortions in
the United States; similar laws
passed in other states have been
universally ruled unconstitutional;
and
Whereas, under Senate Bill 23 doctors and others who perform abortions would face felony charges if
they perform an abortion after
detecting a heartbeat or if they fail
to perform an abdominal or transvaginal ultrasound to check for a
heartbeat; and
Whereas, threatening doctors with
prison time and fines for performing
this
medical procedure will negatively impact the ability of this city
to attract and retain qualified medical professionals; and
Whereas, rather than implementing regressive and extreme policies
like Senate Bill 23, Ohio legislators
should instead focus on implementing and providing supportive services not only to reduce unintended
pregnancies but also to assist pregnant women, and to promote the success of families by investing in
comprehensive sex education, access
to contraceptives, parenting classes
and quality affordable childcare;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council opposes Senate Bill 23 that prohibits abortion when a fetal heartbeat is
detected.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 482-2019.
By Council Member Zone.
An emergency resolution urging
the
Ohio
General
Assembly
to
increase the Ohio Rape Crisis Centers Line Item in the Ohio Operating
Budget
from
$1,550,000
to
$3,000,000 per fiscal year.
Whereas, sexual assault affects
persons of all social, racial, religious, ethnic, socioeconomic, and
age groups in the Cleveland community; and
Whereas, taking many forms, sexual violence can include incest, child
abuse, commercial sex trafficking,
sexual harassment, stalking, and
acquaintance, stranger, spousal, and
gang rape, and nearly seventy percent of these crimes are committed
by individuals known to the victim;
and

42
Whereas, according to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention,
approximately one in five women
and one in seventy-one men will
experience rape or an attempted
rape at some point in their lives,
with children and young adults
being at a significant risk of this
crime; and
Whereas, along with the immediate physical and emotional costs of
sexual assault, the victims can have
such adverse consequences as posttraumatic stress disorder, substance
use, major depression, homelessness,
eating disorders, and suicide, providing that sexual assault survivors
suffer from emotional scars long
after the physical scars have healed;
these impacts are visible in the
Cleveland community; and
Whereas, this Council recognizes
and affirms the efforts of Cleveland
Rape Crisis Center and Ohio’s additional 30 Rape Crisis Programs, complying with the Ohio Core Rape
Crisis
Center
Standards,
that
respond to survivors of sexual violence and work to prevent its occurrence in Cleveland and across the
state; and
Whereas, in Cuyahoga, and three
other counties, Cleveland Rape Crisis Center provided life-saving services to more than 10,000 survivors
of sexual violence and their loved
ones in 2018; and
Whereas, Cleveland Rape Crisis
Center and Ohio’s Rape Crisis Programs are eligible for support from
the Ohio Rape Crisis Centers Line
Item that has supported the expansion of services in Ohio from 42
counties in 2014 to 75 counties in
2019; and
Whereas, an increase in the line
item from $1,550,000 to $3,000,000 per
fiscal year is crucial to supporting
efforts to increase services at Cleveland
Rape
Crisis
Center
and
throughout the state of Ohio; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the usual daily operation of
a municipal department; now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the
Ohio
General
Assembly
to
increase the Ohio Rape Crisis Centers Line Item in the Operating Budget from $1,550,000 to $3,000,000 per
fiscal year.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit a copy of
this resolution to the Ohio General
Assembly and Cassie Gaffney, Director of Government Affairs, Cleveland Rape Crisis Center.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted April 22, 2019.
Effective April 24, 2019.

to Ant Hill, LLC, 10300 Union
Avenue and patio, Cleveland, Ohio
44105, Permit No. 02283900005; and
Whereas, the granting of this
application for a liquor permit to
this high crime area, which is
already saturated with other liquor
outlets, is contrary to the best interests of the entire community; and
Whereas, the applicant does not
qualify to be a permit holder and/or
has demonstrated that he has operated his liquor business in disregard
of the laws, regulations or local
ordinances of this state or any other
state; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought has not conformed
to the building, safety or health
requirements of the governing body
of this County or City; and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so arranged or
constructed that law enforcement
officers or agents of the Division of
Liquor Control are prevented reasonable access to the establishment;
and
Whereas, the place for which the
permit is sought is so located with
respect to the neighborhood that it
substantially interferes with public
decency, sobriety, peace or good
order; and
Whereas, this objection is based
on other legal grounds as set forth
in Revised Code Section 4303.292;
and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure providing for the immediate preservation
of the public peace, prosperity, safety and welfare pursuant to Section
4303.26 of the Ohio Revised Code.

requests
the

of

Section 2. That the Clerk of Council be and she is hereby directed to
transmit two certified copies of this
resolution, together with two copies
of a letter of objection and two
copies of a letter requesting that the
hearing be held in Cleveland, Cuyahoga County.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force

DEPARTMENT OF
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
SUMMARY FOR THE
LEGISLATIVE FILE
Project
Name:
Tappan
Building
Development
Project
Address:
2703
Scranton
Road, Cleveland, OH 44113
Developer: Sustainable Community
Associates, LTD. or Designee
Project Manager: Dan Kennedy
Ward/Councilperson: 3-Kerry McCormack
City Assistance: Non-School TIF
Project Summary and Discussion
Sustainable
Community
Associates, LTD or designee, (“Developer”)
is proposing a mixed use development located at 2703 Scranton Road,
Cleveland, OH 44113 (“Project Site”).
In order to assist with the project
financing,
the
Developer
has
requested the City impose a 5709.41,
30-Year, Non-School TIF. The TIF
will support debt service related to
the project and assist with the
development
of
95
market
rate
apartments,
approximately
2,148
square feet of retail space, and
parking for residents. The project
will create and/or cause to create 8
new full-time jobs at the Project
Site with an approximate payroll of
$400,000.
The new $22M building will be
located across the street from the
recently restored, Wagner Awning
Building. The first floor will feature
a bakery, gym, lounge, and amenity
spaces. At 4 stories and 95 unites,
the building is designed to balance
Wagner Awning and anchor a southern gateway into Tremont. The
units will primarily be studios and
smaller 1-bedrooms, complementing
the larger 1-bedroom units at Wagner Awning, which are fully leased.
Because the lending is partially
structured as an opportunity zone
investment, they are able to include
a work-force housing component to
the project. This has the net effect
of keeping 60% of the units at rents
$250-300 below competing developments in Ohio City.

The site is a 1.7 acre former gas
station. Once complete, the project
will fill in a major vacancy in the
center of the historic Scranton Road
Corridor that links Metro Hospital’s
expanding campus to the new developments on the Scranton Peninsula
in the Flats.
Proposed City Assistance
• The request to Cleveland City
Council is to authorize the
Director of Economic Development to enter into a 30-year
non-school
Tax
Increment
Finance (TIF) agreement with
Sustainable Community Associates, LTD and/or its designee.
The City will declare certain
improvements with respect to
the project to be a public purpose and exempt 100% of the
improvements from real property taxes.
• Under the agreement, parcels
acquired and re-conveyed to the
developer will be subject to a
TIF under Section 5709.41 of the
Ohio Revised Code in consideration for the developer agreeing
to
make
certain
improvements to those parcels
and making payments in lieu of
taxes (PILOTs) equal to the
taxes that would have been
paid for those parcels but for
the TIF. A portion of the
PILOT will be paid to the
Cleveland Municipal School District in the amount the District
would have otherwise received
but for the TIF.
• The TIF will be immediately
effective
on
the
residential
after the expiration of the 15year, 100% tax abatement.

Project Summary and Discussion
CLE Dexter LLC and/or designee
(“Developer”) is proposing a mixed
use development located at 1578
West 28th Street, Cleveland, OH
44113 (corner of West 28th Street
and Franklin Boulevard) (“Project
Site”). In order to assist with the
project financing, the Developer has
requested the City impose a 5709.41,
30-Year, Non-School TIF. The TIF
will support debt service related to
the project and assist with the
development of the Dexter Apartment Building, including approximately
112
market
rate
and
workforce housing apartment units,
8,800 square feet of retail space and
indoor parking for residents. The
project will create and/or cause to
create 26 new full-time jobs at the
Project Site with an approximate
payroll of $700,000.
CLE Dexter LLC is an entity of
Casto. Casto is a privately held,
fully integrated real estate services
firm, with more than 85 years of
successful development and management of commercial, industrial
and residential real estate. Casto is
a team of more than 270 individuals

for the parcel but for the TIF. A
portion of the PILOTs will be
paid to the Cleveland Metropolitan School District in the amount
the District would have otherwise
received but for the TIF by the
County
(“District
Payments”).
The balance of the PILOTS will
be utilized to fund eligible project
costs and project debt. The developer will be responsible for any
shortfall of PILOT payments for
project costs.
