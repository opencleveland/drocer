FIRST READING EMERGENCY
RESOLUTION REFERRED
Res. No. 216-2019.
By Council Member B. Jones.
An emergency resolution urging
the Mayor of the City of Cleveland
and the Superintendent of the Cleveland Municipal School District to
consider developing and implementing a community-wide educational
awareness initiative on human trafficking in order to educate and
increase public awareness on this
major public health and safety
issue.
Whereas, human trafficking is a
human rights violation, especially in
sex trade, slavery, and involuntary
servitude, defined as the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of persons, by
means of threat or use of force or
other forms of coercion, or abduction, or fraud, of deception, of the
abuse of power or of a position of
vulnerability or the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to
achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for
the purpose of exploitation; and
Whereas, globally and in the United States human trafficking, especially sex trafficking, disproportionately affects women and girls; and
Whereas, human trafficking also
affects highly vulnerable populations to human trafficking activities
including but not limited to the economically vulnerable, persons with
disabilities, and runaway youth,
with disproportionate vulnerability
for youth who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender; and
Whereas, victims of human trafficking in the United States have
been identified in multiple legal and
illicit industries that can often
expose them to physical, sexual and
psychological abuse that can lead to
serious and complex health and psychological consequences; and
Whereas, worldwide, human trafficking generates approximately $36
billion each year, where $1 dollar
for every $4 dollars circulates in the
United States, where freedom is an
inalienable right; and
Whereas, commercial sex trafficking includes “the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision or
obtaining of a person for the purposes of a commercial sex act; “children in “the life” are considered victims of severe forms of trafficking,
and they are in our schools; and
Whereas, every year, hundreds of
thousands of children, mostly girls
in early adolescence, are at risk for
human trafficking whereby they are
subjected to physical, verbal and
sexual abuse, as well as facing
social isolation, lack of care, manipulation, and severe health concerns,
including HIV, and are subject to
severe emotional trauma and must
overcome stigmatization and posttraumatic stress, and in some states
they may face the threat of a criminal record; and
Whereas, according to the 2017
Ohio
State’s
Attorney
General’s
Human
Trafficking
Commission
report, authorities investigated 202
human trafficking cases in 2017 that
amounted to a 50 percent increase
over the previous year, and the
majority of those cases involved the
sex trade; and
Whereas, according to a study by
the University of Toledo Human
Trafficking and Social Justice Institute social media is increasingly

The City Record
being exploited to contact recruit
and sell children for sex, and another study that was requested by the
Ohio
Attorney
General’s
Human
Trafficking
Commission
revealed
how traffickers in human trafficking often target and connect with
vulnerable children on the internet
and social media; and
Whereas, it is vitally important to
educate parents, professionals, and
youth especially in middle school or
teenage daughters who may be
unaware
about
the
dangers
of
online predatory practices used by
master manipulators in human trafficking; and
Whereas, public awareness about
human trafficking still needs to
reach broader communities and communicate more information to the
public about the nuances of this
crime, and how the use of the internet and social media are becoming
more popular tools that human traffickers use to target their victims;
and
Whereas, there are limited studies
in the United States on the profile
of traffickers and their unique patterns of perpetration, as well as specific statistics on human trafficking
activities and crimes that are taking place in communities across the
country; and
Whereas, community educational
prevention
programs
addressing
human trafficking and re-trafficking are needed for those in health
care,
middle
schools
and
highschools,
and
other
community
venues and the law enforcement
community in order to educate the
public on this serious social problem
to increase public awareness; and.
Whereas,
citizens,
health
and
social
service
providers,
school
teachers and law enforcement officers need training and tools to identify and attend to victims of human
trafficking
effectively,
and
to
become more educated and aware on
how information and communications technologies are being used
for human trafficking; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
the development of educational presentations on human trafficking
workshops at neighborhood community
centers,
Cleveland
Public
Schools and throughout all five
police districts in the city of Cleveland in order to educate citizens,
youth, teachers and law enforcement
officers about learning how to identify victims of human trafficking as
well as knowing how to monitor
internet and social media activity of
teenage youth in order to safeguard
them from human trafficking predators as well as becoming aware
about the various resources such as
local and national human trafficking hotlines, and other agencies that
provide helpful information on this
topic; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
local law enforcement to begin collecting more specific crime data and
statistics
on
human
trafficking
activities that are taking place within the city of Cleveland to thoroughly identify by category, victims,
and
specific
human
trafficking
activities that are taking place in
the city of Cleveland; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,

177

Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:

ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 149-2019.
By Mayor Jackson and Council
Members Griffin, Kelley and McCormack.
An
emergency
resolution
reaffirming this Council’s and the
City’s commitment to addressing
childhood lead poisoning and supporting the formation of the Lead
Safe Cleveland Coalition to confront
lead poisoning in the City and to
effectively advance lead safe efforts
through implementation of a Lead
Safe Solution.
Whereas, both this Council and
the Jackson administration understand the urgency of confronting
childhood lead poisoning in Cleveland and recognize it is unacceptable for any child to have lead poisoning; and
Whereas, for the past 12 months,
this Council and the Jackson Administration have been working with
public and private institutions, philanthropic and non-profit organizations, and other community stakeholders to formulate a comprehensive,
sustainable,
preventative
approach to the lead crisis that will
provide enforceable, affordable and
lasting solutions; and
Whereas, in June, 2018, a delegation comprised of the above entities
attended the National Environmental Health Association’s 2018 Annual Educational Conference and HUD
Healthy Homes Conference for indepth discussions with national lead
experts and to gather information
on local and national best practices
for
lead
poisoning
prevention,
awareness, and education; and
Whereas, this same delegation
participated
in
the
Cleveland-

February 13, 2019
Rochester Learning Exchange in
Rochester, New York, to learn about
Rochester's success in reducing
lead poisoning by over 80% in about
10 years; and
Whereas, this Council and the
Jackson administration realize that
lead poisoning is a complex, systemic problem that requires a collaborative effort to correct; because
no single entity can successfully
tackle the lead issue, Council and
the Jackson Administration will continue to work with other community stakeholders to identify policy,
system, and program changes to better prevent lead poisoning; and
Whereas, to this end, a collaborative Lead Safe Cleveland Coalition
has been formed that includes representatives from this Council, the
Mayor
of
Cleveland,
the
City’s
Departments
of
Public
Health,
Building and Housing, and Community Development, and members of
many public and private institutions
and organizations including: Cuyahoga County Board of Health and
Department of Development, Case
Western Reserve University, the
Cleveland
Foundation,
Enterprise
Community Partners, Environmental
Health
Watch,
Federal
Reserve
Bank of Cleveland, the Bruening
Foundation, the George Gund Foundation, Mt. Sinai Health Care Foundation, Saint Luke’s Foundation, Sisters of Charity Foundation of Cleveland, Third Federal Foundation,
United Way of Greater Cleveland,
the Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland Metropolitan School District, Concerned
Citizens Organized Against Lead,
Legal Aid Society of Cleveland, the
MetroHealth
System,
SherwinWilliams Company, Sisters of Charity Health System, University Hospitals, UH Rainbow Babies & Children’s Hospital, and Zion Hill Missionary Baptist Church; and
Whereas, the Lead Safe Cleveland
Coalition will work toward a Lead
Safe
Solution:
a
cost-effective
approach that recognizes that homes
built before 1978, like the majority
of homes in Cleveland, can be made
lead safe by using interim controls
or safety measures, to remediate
lead and to eliminate the possibility of poisoning; and
Whereas, the Lead Safe Solution
means an effective collaboration of
smart, adaptable public policies,
knowledgeable agencies and systems willing to collaborate, proven
community programs, and public
sector and private sector accountability; the Lead Safe Solution will
provide a comprehensive, sustainable and preventative approach to
address lead poisoning; and
Whereas, the Lead Safe Cleveland
Coalition will update Cleveland’s
existing lead hazard ordinances by
introducing comprehensive legislation that addresses four key areas:
prevention,
screening,
treatments
and interventions, and education
and outreach; this legislation will
address childhood lead poisoning in
ways that are sustainable, enforceable, and affordable, based on what
has been learned through continued
exchanges with experts; and
Whereas, the Lead Safe Cleveland
Coalition will hold a Cleveland Lead
Summit and will invite local and
national experts, landlords, media,
advocates,
community
members,
elected officials, and others to learn

The City Record
about strategies to prevent lead poisoning, to launch an educational
campaign, to work on the Lead Safe
Solution together and to commit to
a common goal to decrease childhood lead poisoning by 90% in 10
years; and
Whereas, a Cleveland Lead Safe
Home Fund will be created to support
the
Coalition’s
work
with
resources from public-private partnerships between the City, philanthropic and corporate sectors; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health, or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council reaffirms its and the City’s commitment to addressing childhood lead
poisoning and supports the formation of a Lead Safe Cleveland Coalition to confront lead poisoning in
the City and to effectively advance
lead safe efforts through implementation of the Lead Safe Solution.
Section 2. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise, it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted February 4, 2019.
Effective February 5, 2019.

Ord. No. 65-2019.
By Council Members B. Jones,
Polensek, Brancatelli and Kelley
(by departmental Request)
