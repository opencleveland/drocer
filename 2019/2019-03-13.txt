ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS
AND ORDINANCES
Res. No. 216-2019.
By Council Member B. Jones.
An emergency resolution urging
the Mayor of the City of Cleveland
and the Superintendent of the Cleveland Municipal School District to
consider developing and implementing a community-wide educational
awareness initiative on human trafficking in order to educate and
increase public awareness on this
major public health and safety
issue.
Whereas, human trafficking is a
human rights violation, especially in
sex trade, slavery, and involuntary
servitude, defined as the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of persons, by
means of threat or use of force or
other forms of coercion, or abduction, or fraud, of deception, of the
abuse of power or of a position of
vulnerability or the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to
achieve the consent of a person having control over another person for
the purpose of exploitation; and
Whereas, globally and in the United States human trafficking, especially sex trafficking, disproportionately affects women and girls; and
Whereas, human trafficking also
affects highly vulnerable populations to human trafficking activities
including but not limited to the economically vulnerable, persons with
disabilities, and runaway youth,
with disproportionate vulnerability
for youth who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender; and
Whereas, victims of human trafficking in the United States have
been identified in multiple legal and
illicit industries that can often
expose them to physical, sexual and
psychological abuse that can lead to
serious and complex health and psychological consequences; and
Whereas, worldwide, human trafficking generates approximately $36
billion each year, where $1 dollar
for every $4 dollars circulates in the
United States, where freedom is an
inalienable right; and
Whereas, commercial sex trafficking includes “the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision or
obtaining of a person for the purposes of a commercial sex act; “children in “the life” are considered victims of severe forms of trafficking,
and they are in our schools; and
Whereas, every year, hundreds of
thousands of children, mostly girls

The City Record
in early adolescence, are at risk for
human trafficking whereby they are
subjected to physical, verbal and
sexual abuse, as well as facing
social isolation, lack of care, manipulation, and severe health concerns,
including HIV, and are subject to
severe emotional trauma and must
overcome stigmatization and posttraumatic stress, and in some states
they may face the threat of a criminal record; and
Whereas, according to the 2017
Ohio
State’s
Attorney
General’s
Human
Trafficking
Commission
report, authorities investigated 202
human trafficking cases in 2017 that
amounted to a 50 percent increase
over the previous year, and the
majority of those cases involved the
sex trade; and
Whereas, according to a study by
the University of Toledo Human
Trafficking and Social Justice Institute social media is increasingly
being exploited to contact recruit
and sell children for sex, and another study that was requested by the
Ohio
Attorney
General’s
Human
Trafficking
Commission
revealed
how traffickers in human trafficking often target and connect with
vulnerable children on the internet
and social media; and
Whereas, it is vitally important to
educate parents, professionals, and
youth especially in middle school or
teenage daughters who may be
unaware
about
the
dangers
of
online predatory practices used by
master manipulators in human trafficking; and
Whereas, public awareness about
human trafficking still needs to
reach broader communities and communicate more information to the
public about the nuances of this
crime, and how the use of the internet and social media are becoming
more popular tools that human traffickers use to target their victims;
and
Whereas, there are limited studies
in the United States on the profile
of traffickers and their unique patterns of perpetration, as well as specific statistics on human trafficking
activities and crimes that are taking place in communities across the
country; and
Whereas, community educational
prevention
programs
addressing
human trafficking and re-trafficking are needed for those in health
care,
middle
schools
and
highschools,
and
other
community
venues and the law enforcement
community in order to educate the
public on this serious social problem
to increase public awareness; and.
Whereas,
citizens,
health
and
social
service
providers,
school
teachers and law enforcement officers need training and tools to identify and attend to victims of human
trafficking
effectively,
and
to
become more educated and aware on
how information and communications technologies are being used
for human trafficking; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
the development of educational presentations on human trafficking
workshops at neighborhood community
centers,
Cleveland
Public
Schools and throughout all five
police districts in the city of Cleveland in order to educate citizens,
youth, teachers and law enforcement
officers about learning how to identify victims of human trafficking as

321

25
well as knowing how to monitor
internet and social media activity of
teenage youth in order to safeguard
them from human trafficking predators as well as becoming aware
about the various resources such as
local and national human trafficking hotlines, and other agencies that
provide helpful information on this
topic; and
Whereas, this Council encourages
local law enforcement to begin collecting more specific crime data and
statistics
on
human
trafficking
activities that are taking place within the city of Cleveland to thoroughly identify by category, victims,
and
specific
human
trafficking
activities that are taking place in
the city of Cleveland; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council urges
the Mayor of the City of Cleveland
and the Superintendent of the Cleveland Municipal School District to
consider developing and implementing a community-wide educational
awareness initiative on human trafficking in order to educate and
increase public awareness on this
major public health and safety
issue.
Section 2. That the Council of the
City of Cleveland hereby directs the
Clerk of Council to transmit copies
of this resolution to Mayor Frank
Jackson, City of Cleveland and to
Eric Gordon, Superintendent of the
Cleveland Public School District.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
Adopted March 4, 2019.
Effective March 5, 2019.

Res. No. 265-2019.
By Council Members McCormack
and Hairston.
An emergency resolution supporting the appeal for an increase in
state investments in public transportation.
Whereas, currently, Ohio ranks
near the bottom among states for
public transportation funding; and
Whereas, for too long, Ohio has
underinvested in public transportation and alternative transportation
options; and
Whereas,
satisfactory
public
transportation is an issue of equity:
inadequate
public
transportation
options make it harder for many
Ohioans to go about their daily lives
- get to work, attend class, or see a
doctor; and
Whereas, State Representatives
Skindell and Upchurch have called
for an increase in state investment
in public transit; and
Whereas,
reinvesting
in
the
state’s infrastructure will attract
business and development, connect
people to jobs and services and help
grow Ohio’s economy; and

26
Whereas, public transposition is
critical to short and long term economic development; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council hereby supports the appeal for an
increase in state investments in public transportation.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to transmit copies of
this resolution to all members of the
Ohio legislature.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
