Section 3. That the Director of
Law shall prepare the permit authorized by this ordinance and shall
incorporate such additional provisions as the director determines necessary to protect and benefit the
public interest. The permit shall be
issued only when, in the opinion of
the Director of Law, a prospective
Permittee has properly indemnified
the City against any loss that may
result from the encroachments permitted.
Section 4. That the permit shall
reserve to the City reasonable right
of entry to the encroachment locations.
Section 5. That this ordinance is
declared to be an emergency measure and, provided it receives the
affirmative vote of two-thirds of all
the members elected to Council, it
shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its passage and

Whereas, Governor DeWine has
proposed an 18-cent per gallon gas
tax increase in the state transportation budget to pay for road
construction projects; and
Whereas, the state has not raised
the gas tax in 14 years: the tax has
been 28 cents a gallon since 2005;
and
Whereas, the current 28 cents per
gallon tax is insufficient for state
and local governments to maintain
current roads or finish major new
construction projects – by 2023, the
state will have zero money for road
improvements or road safety projects; and
Whereas, last week, Ohio House
republicans approved a 10.7 cents
per gallon gas tax increase, which
the Governor has decried as a “minimalist approach” to addressing the
state’s infrastructure needs that will
jeopardize the safety of Ohioans;
and
Whereas, imminently, the state
will begin paying $390 million per
year to service highway bonds that
have paid for road and highway projects over the previous several
years; and
Whereas, a gas tax increase of 18
cents a gallon would raise $2.5 billion in additional revenue over the
next two years, compared to about
$1.1 billion in the House proposal;
and
Whereas, the Governor’s 18 cent
gas tax increase would allow local
governments more choice about how
to spend local funds; and
Whereas, the governor’s proposed
18 cent gas tax increase will ensure
that major infrastructure projects
are not delayed and further will
ensure that the our roads and infrastructure remain in satisfactory condition for the safety of Ohioans; and
Whereas, this resolution constitutes an emergency measure for the
immediate preservation of public
peace, property, health or safety,
now, therefore,
Be it resolved by the Council of
the City of Cleveland:
Section 1. That this Council supports Governor DeWine’s proposed
18 cent gas tax increase to fund
road construction projects.
Section 2. That the Clerk of Council is directed to forward a copy of
this
resolution
Governor
Mike
DeWine and all members of the
Ohio legislature.
Section 3. That this resolution is
hereby declared to be an emergency
measure and, provided it receives
the affirmative vote of two-thirds of
all the members elected to Council,
it shall take effect and be in force
immediately upon its adoption and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise it
shall take effect and be in force
from and after the earliest period
allowed by law.
